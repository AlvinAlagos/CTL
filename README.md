# CTL

## Description
CTL Inc. is the renovation company I currently work at as a part-timer. It is a small, independent company that is currently being run by one person and a few other workers. With a few people in the company, it gets difficult to keep track of all inventory items, client information, workerâ€™s hours, income, expenditure, etc. The purpose of this web application is to be able to keep track of all this information on one platform. This will include two types of users: employee and admin (Only the one running the company gets access to this). I chose this as a project because, I also faced the issue of having to manage all the hours I worked and giving it in without an actual proper system to report to. So I was naturally always curious of what would be the best solution for this problem.

# User dashboard
The user dashboard consists of 5 widgets with each having their unique purpose they are the following:
  * __Clockin Widget__: This widget allows users to clock in the hours they worked for in a day simulating the punch in/out.
  * __User Widget__: This widget is just a fixed display of the users information. If ever anything needed to be updated, I built it so everything will be done on the admin side.
  * __Project listings Widget__: This widget is in charge of displaying all projects that were assigned by the admin to the employee.
  * __Monthly Income Widget__: This widget represents a simple chart that displays the income the employee made throughout the months. (weekly and yearly were not implemented due to time constraint)
  * __Timesheet__: This widget is just the listing of the hours worked by the employee.

# Conclusion
I feel there's still alot more to do with this web app and that I've barely touched the surface of what I want it to be. I plan to re-work the application after the bootcamp since I built it under pressure since there was a tight deadline compared to the vast ideas I wanted to implement. But, the tight deadline was good practice of simulating crunch time and I'm still happy with what I was able to do under two weeks, it was a fun project.
